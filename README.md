*Production-ready monitoring dashboard built with Grafana shows real-time system metrics, game statistics, user activity, and performance data. Custom metrics track game-specific events like match completions, user registrations, and system load.*

The monitoring setup includes:
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage via Node Exporter
- **Application Metrics**: Custom game events, user actions, WebSocket connections
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times, database queries, error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Active users, games played, tournament completions
